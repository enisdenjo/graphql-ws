## Reporting Issues

Issues are for bugs or features. Please consider the following checklist.

### Checklist

- [x] Does your title concisely summarize the problem?
- [x] Is it possible for you to include a minimal, reproducable example? Is it an [SSCCE](http://sscce.org)?
- [x] What OS and browser are you using? What versions?
- [x] Did you use a Issue Template?

### General Guidelines

- **Keep it concise.** Longer issues are harder to understand.
- **Keep it focused.** Solving three vague problems is harder than solving one specific problem.
- **Be friendly!** Everyone is working hard and trying to be effective.

### [Git Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)

This repository follows the [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) for auto-generating the documentation and keeping readability high.

## Comments in Code

We use a convention for comments in code:
{NOTE/FIXME/TODO}-{initials}-{YYMMDD} descriptive text

so for example: // TODO-db-19001 leaving a todo note here for the next guy (or future me)
